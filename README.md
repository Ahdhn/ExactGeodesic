# ExactGeodesic
This is an implementation of exact discrete geodesic algorithm proposed in [1] and improved in [2]. It computes geodesics on 2-manifold triangular meshes. 

Note that the algorithm itself can apply on both orientable and non-orientable surfaces, but here only orientable case is supported due to the data structure adopted.
